title: "Estimation of Road Transverse Slope Using Crowd-Sourced Data from Smartphones"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Abstract: Integration of information on road transverse geometric features
such as cross slope and superelevation in digital maps can widen
the scope of its applications, which is primarily navigation, by enabling
driving safety and efficiency applications such as Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The huge scale and dynamic
nature of road networks make sensing such road geometric features
a challenging task. Traditional methods oftentimes suffer from
high cost, limited scalability and update frequency, as well as poor
sensing accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a costeffective
and scalable road transverse slope estimation framework
using sensor data from smartphones. Based on error characteristics
of smartphone sensors, we intelligently combine data from
accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS to estimate road transverse slope
profile of a road segment. To improve accuracy and robustness of
the system, the estimations of road transverse slope from multiple
sources/vehicles are crowd-sourced to compensate for the effects
of varying quality of sensor data from different sources. Extensive
experimental evaluation on a test route of 9km demonstrates the
superior performance of our proposed method, achieving 350%
improvement on road transverse slope estimation accuracy over
existing methods, with 90% of errors below 0.5◦.'
