## Abstract
Integration of information on road transverse geometric features such as cross slope and superelevation in digital maps can widen the scope of its applications, which is primarily navigation, by enabling driving safety and efficiency applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The huge scale and dynamic
nature of road networks make sensing such road geometric features a challenging task. Traditional methods often suffer from high cost, limited scalability and update frequency, as well as poor sensing accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a costeffective and scalable road transverse slope estimation framework using sensor data from smartphones. Based on error characteristics of smartphone sensors, we intelligently combine data from accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS to estimate road transverse slope profile of a road segment. To improve accuracy and robustness of the system, the estimations of road transverse slope from multiple sources/vehicles are crowd-sourced to compensate for the effects
of varying quality of sensor data from different sources. Extensive experimental evaluation on a test route of 9km demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method, achieving 350% improvement on road transverse slope estimation accuracy over existing methods, with 90% of errors below 0.5â—¦.
