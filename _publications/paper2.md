## Abstract 

The last mile delivery in humanitarian relief supply often happens on a tree or an almosttree
network allowing split deliveries. We present a relief delivery model incorporating a tree
network for last mile delivery. We developed a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation
with the goal of minimizing the unsatisfied demand of the population. For better computational
performance, we reformulated the MIP exploiting the tree network structure and
found that this gave an order of magnitude reduction in computational time. To further
improve computational efficiency, we developed a heuristic solution method based on a
decomposition scheme applied to the tree network formulation. This led to the Capacitated
Vehicle Routing Problem on trees with split deliveries, for which we derived a closed-form
solution. This decomposition scheme resulted in a further order of magnitude reduction in
computation time. To demonstrate the application of our approach we applied our model
to the humanitarian logistics relief operation encountered in the 2015 Nepal earthquake.'
