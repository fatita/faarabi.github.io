## Abstract
This paper studies server positioning and response strategies for spatially arriving jobs with degradation, for situations of light and medium traffic. For the light traffic case it is shown that the p-median
solution provides the optimum server positioning, and the optimum response strategy involves no server
cooperation. To analyze the medium traffic case, an extended Hypercube queuing model tailored to
handle spatially distributed jobs with degradation rate is formulated. The steady state probabilities
from this model are used to obtain system performance measures.An appropriate set of preferred server
assignments are developed for each region. Results are presented for different problem-size instances.
To demonstrate applicability of the model, a case study is presented based on an emergency response
application. The main findings for the medium traffic case are that the degree of server cooperation
is strongly related to the rate of job degradation and to the cost of assigning jobs that find all servers
busy to a backup serverâ€”higher job degradation rates and higher cost of assigning a job to a backup
server result in lower server cooperation.
