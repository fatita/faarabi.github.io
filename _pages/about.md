I am a data scientist at San Diego Gas & Electric. 

Prior to that I pursued my Ph.D. in Operations Reseaerch at State University of New York at Buffalo. I did my research under supervision of my advisor [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/school/about/people/rajan-batta.html)

My research interests are applications of Operations Research and data science in urban problems.
