I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu) and my doctoral research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing during disasters and crisis for better resposne and improved decision making. I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). I am skilled in machine learning, statistical modeling and mathematical optimisation and leverage them in my research goals. Apart from my doctoral research, I also have some experience genomic data analysis for cancer research. 


Apart from my research I also have an interest in philosophy, in particular philosophy of science and philosophy of mind. As a hooby I read about these subjects and write my thoughts pertaining to them.
