Hi! Welcome to my website. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu) and my research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing for better response and improved decision making during disasters and crisis. I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). 

I am fascinated by the adavances in machine learning in the past few years which has led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. This has provided a huge opportunitiy for improving decision models in Operations Research and Management Science to use actionable data and insights from these upstream AI models as paramters and optimse for better real-time decisions. In my doctoral research, I use this approach in improving real-time decisions for disaster management. I have developed [natural language processing methodlogies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that convert noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis into actionable information for decision making models. Using this method we could sense and forecast shortage of gasoline in 8 cities of Florida during onset of Hurricane Irma. Furthermore, I have built methodologies that leverage this actionable information in [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) to determine optimal strategies for searching, managing and distributing essential commodities like gasoline. Currently, I am building a reinforecement learning method which makes real-time and dynamic decsions about sharing and redistribution of PPE's and medical equipments amonngst during shortages like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prior to this, I have experience in building machine learning methods for genomics data analysis and cancer research during my stint as Research Assitant in a [collaboration](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms) between [ACTREC](https://actrec.gov.in/home) and [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about.saplabsindia.html). My master's thesis research was focussed on humanitarian logistics and I developed [efficient solution methods](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper2/) for my relief supply model on a tree network. I have collaborated with the [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm), the connected and autonomous vehicles group at UB and developed a [method for estimation of road transverse slope](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/) using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones. In my internship at NBCUniversal, I developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6).
