Hi! Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu) and my research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing during disasters and crisis for better response and improved decision making. I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). I have built [natural language processing methodlogies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that use noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis scenarios and convert them into actionable information for decision making models. In particular, I have built methods that can sense and forecast shortage of essential commodities like gasoline, water, food, PPE's. Furthermore, I leverage this information in [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) to determine optimal strategies for searching, managing and distributing these commodities. 

Beyond my doctoral research, I have experience in building compuatational tools and machine learning methods for genomics data analysis and cancer research during my stint as Research Assitant in a [collaboration](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms) between [ACTREC](https://actrec.gov.in/home) and [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about.saplabsindia.html). My master's thesis research was focussed on humanitarin logistics and I developed [efficient solution methods](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper2/) for my relief supply model on a tree network. I have collaborated with the [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm), the connected and autonomous vehicles group at UB and developed a method for [estimation of road transverse slope using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/). In my internship at NBCUniversal, I developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6).
