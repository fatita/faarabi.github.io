Hi! Welcome to my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/school/about/people/rajan-batta.html) and [Dr. Qing He](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/people/faculty_directory/qing-he.html)

My doctoral research is funded by National Science Foundation for development of methods of [social sensing during disasters](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1663101&HistoricalAwards=false) for better management of essential supplies. I develop [Natural Language Processing methodolgies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that convert noisy information on social media platforms during crisis into actionable information. Further, I develop  [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) using tecniques of Operations Research that use this information from social media to determine optimal decisions for people affetcted by disasters, first responders and decision making authorities. These I have applied these methods for managing of gasoline during crisis like Hurricane Irma. Currently, I am developing a [reinforcement learning based solution](https://github.com/akrm3008/Covid-19-PPE-Distribution) for dynamic supply and re-distribution of PPE's to different demand points during a Covid-19 like Pandemic.

I am also interested in using tools that solve problems in other domains. I built a machine learning tool that could identify driver mutations passenger mutations in genomics data for different cancer types as part of [Project Genomics](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms). I have worked with [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm) and developed a [method for estimation of road transverse slope](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/) using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones. I have developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6) at NBCUniversal for their GolfNow product.

Beyond scientific research, I am have a keen interest in philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing and doing some amateur philosophy. It is available to read at [my substack](https://abhinavkhare.substack.com/). If you like it, you can subscribe to my newsletter.
