Hi! Welcome to my website.

I am Ph.D. in Operations Research. In the past year my work has been focussed on applications of AI in Fianace. Currently, I am working in application of machine learning to detect manipulations in financial markets. 

Formerly, I had pursued my Ph.D. in Operations Research at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I was advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/school/about/people/rajan-batta.html) and [Dr. Qing He](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/people/faculty_directory/qing-he.html).

My doctoral research was focussed on development of methods of [social sensing during disasters](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1663101&HistoricalAwards=false) for better management of essential supplies. I developed [Natural Language Processing methodolgies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that extract actionable information from noisy information on social media platforms during crisis. Further, I develop [Decision Models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) using tecniques of Operations Research that use this information from social media to determine optimal decisions for people affetcted by disasters, first responders and decision making authorities. These I have applied these methods for managing of gasoline during crisis like Hurricane Irma.

Continuing work in this direction, I am developing a [Reinforcement Learning based solution](https://github.com/akrm3008/Covid-19-PPE-Distribution) for dynamic supply and re-distribution of PPE's to different demand points during a Covid-19 like Pandemic.

In the past, I have built tools in other domains as well. I have worked on a classifier to identify driver mutations and passenger mutations from genomics data for different cancer types as part of [Project Genomics](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms). I have worked with [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm) and contributed to developing a [method for estimation of road transverse slope](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/) using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones. I have developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6) at NBCUniversal for their GolfNow product.

Beyond scientific research and building such application, I have a keen interest in Analytic Philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing. Some of it is available to read at [my substack](https://abhinavkhare.substack.com/). If you like it, you can subscribe to my newsletter.
