I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu) and my research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing during disasters and crisis for better response and improved decision making. I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). I have built natural language processing methodlogies that use noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis scenarios and convert them into actionable information for decision making models. In particular, I have built methods that can sense and forecast shortage of essential commodities like gasoline, water, food, PPE's during natural disasters and pandemics. Furthermore, I leverage this information in decision making models to determine optimal strategies for searching, managing and distributing these commodities. 

Apart from my doctoral research, I have experience in humanitarian logistics in
