Hi! Welcome to my website.
My name is Fatemeh and I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Reseaerch from State University of New York at Buffalo. I did my research under supervision of my advisor [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/school/about/people/rajan-batta.html)

Besides my studies I am interested in painting, hiking and reading books.
