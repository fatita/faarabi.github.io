Hi! Welcome to my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I am advised by Dr. Rajan Batta and Dr. Qing He.

My doctoral research is funded by the National Sciene Foundation and is focussed on developing methods that use social sensing during disasters for better planning and management of essential supplies. I develop Natural Language Processing methodlogies that convert noisy information on social media platforms during crisis into actionable information. Furtermore, I have develop decision making models and their solution methods that use this information from social media to determine optimal decisions for people affetcted by disasters, first responders and decision making authorities. I could show that these methodologies could detect and forecast the demand/shortage of gasoline during Hurricane Irma and plan the routes for evacuators looking for gasoline. Currently I am building a reinforecement learning method to solve the Partially Observable Markov Decision process for making real-time and dynamic decsions about sharing and redistribution of PPEâ€™s amonngst hospitals/regions/states during shortages like the COVID-19 pandemic.


Apart from my doctoral research, I am interested in building tools that solve problems in other domains as well. As Research Assitant in Project Genomics, a [collaboration](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms) between [ACTREC](https://actrec.gov.in/home) and [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about.saplabsindia.html) I built a ML tool that could identify driver mutations (cancer causing mutations) and passenger mutations in genomics data for different cancer types. My master's thesis was focussed on humanitarian logistics, specifically, in development of [efficient solution methods](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper2/) for a relief supply model on a tree network. Recently, I have also collaborated with the [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm), the connected and autonomous vehicles group at UB and developed a [method for estimation of road transverse slope](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/) using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones. In my internship at NBCUniversal, I developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6).

Beyond scientific research, I am have a keen interest in philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing and doing some amateur philosophy. It is available to read at my substack. I would love to get some feedback and comments about the contents of my writings. If you like it, you can subscribe to my newsletter. :)
