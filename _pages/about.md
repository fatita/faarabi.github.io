Hi! Welcome to my website. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu). I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). 

My doctoral research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing for better response and improved decision making during disasters and crisis. I have developed [natural language processing methodlogies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that convert noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis into data for decision making models. Using this method we could detect and forecast shortage of gasoline in 8 cities of Florida during onset of Hurricane Irma. Furthermore, I have built methodologies that leverage this actionable information in [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) to determine optimal strategies for searching essential commodities like gasoline. Currently, I am building a reinforecement learning method which makes real-time and dynamic decsions about sharing and redistribution of PPE's and medical equipments amonngst hospitals/regions/states during shortages like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beyond my doctoral research, I am interested in building tools that solve problems in other domains. As Research Assitant in Project Genomics, a [collaboration](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms) between [ACTREC](https://actrec.gov.in/home) and [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about.saplabsindia.html) I built a ML tool that could identify driver mutations (cancer causing mutations) and passenger mutations in genomics data for different cancer types. My master's thesis research was focussed on humanitarian logistics, specifically, in development of [efficient solution methods](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper2/) for a relief supply model on a tree network. I have also collaborated with the [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm), the connected and autonomous vehicles group at UB and developed a [method for estimation of road transverse slope](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/) using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones. In my internship at NBCUniversal, I developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6).
