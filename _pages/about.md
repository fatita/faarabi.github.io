I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the University at Buffalo. My research is focussed on using social sensing for disaster management. I have built methodologies that use social media data to sense shortage of essential commodities during crisis like natural disasters and pandemics and decision making tools that use this information from social media to make efficient and effective decisions about managing, distributing and searching essential commodities.
