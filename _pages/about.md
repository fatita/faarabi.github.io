Hi! Welcome to my website. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu) and my research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing for better response and improved decision making during disasters and crisis. I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). 

I am fascinated by the adavances in machine learning in the past few years which has led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. This provides a huge opportunitiy for improving decision models in OR/MS which can use actionable data and insights from these upstream AI models as paramters and optimse for better real time decisions. In my doctoral research I exploit this approach for improving real-times decisions in disaster management. I have built [natural language processing methodlogies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that use noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis and convert them into actionable information for decision making models. Using this I could sense and forecast shortages of gasoline in 8 cities of Florida during onset of Hurricane Irma. This methodology can be easily other to other essential commodities like water, food, PPE's. Furthermore, I have built methodologies leveraged these methods to this information in [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) to determine optimal strategies for searching, managing and distributing these commodities. 

Beyond my doctoral research, I have experience in building compuatational tools and machine learning methods for genomics data analysis and cancer research during my stint as Research Assitant in a [collaboration](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/it-services/SAPs-maiden-India-product-to-go-global/articleshow/39889394.cms) between [ACTREC](https://actrec.gov.in/home) and [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about.saplabsindia.html). My master's thesis research was focussed on humanitarin logistics and I developed [efficient solution methods](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper2/) for my relief supply model on a tree network. I have collaborated with the [ICAVE](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm), the connected and autonomous vehicles group at UB and developed a [method for estimation of road transverse slope](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper3/) using Crowd-Sourced data from smartphones. In my internship at NBCUniversal, I developed a [methodology for dynamic pricing](https://akrm3008.github.io/talks/2019-10-26-talk-6).
