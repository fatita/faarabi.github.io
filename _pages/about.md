Hi! Welcome to my website. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu). I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). 

My doctoral research is [funded](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1663101&HistoricalAwards=false) by the national sciene foundation and is focussed on developing methods for social sensing for better response and improved decision making during disasters and crisis. I have developed [natural language processing methodlogies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that convert noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis into data for decision making models. Using this method we could detect and forecast shortage of gasoline in 8 cities of Florida during onset of Hurricane Irma. Furthermore, I have built methodologies that leverage this actionable information in [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) to determine optimal strategies for searching essential commodities like gasoline. Currently, I am building a reinforecement learning method which makes real-time and dynamic decsions about sharing and redistribution of PPE's and medical equipments amonngst hospitals/regions/states during shortages like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beyond scientific research, I am have a keen interest in philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing and doing some amateur philosophy. It is available to read at [my substack](https://abhinavkhare.substack.com/). I would love to get some feedback and comments about the contents of my writings.
