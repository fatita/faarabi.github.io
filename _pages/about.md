Hi! Welcome to my website. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems.html) at [University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu). I am advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~batta/) and [Dr. Qing He](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~qinghe/). 

My doctoral research is funded by the National Sciene Foundation and is focussed on developing methods that use [social sensing during disasters](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1663101&HistoricalAwards=false) for better planning and management of essential supplies. I have developed [Natural Language Processing methodlogies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that convert noisy information produced on social media platforms during crisis into actionable data for decision making models.  Furthermore, I have developed [decision making models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) and their solution methods that use this information from social media to determine optimal decisions for people affetcted by disasters, first responders and decision making authorities. I could show that these methodologies could detect and forecast the demand/shortage of gasoline during Hurricane Irma during and plan the routes for evacuators looking for gasoline. 
Currently I am building a [Reinforecement Learning method](https://github.com/akrm3008/Covid-19-PPE-Distribution) to solve the Partially Observable Markov Decision process for making real-time and dynamic decsions about sharing and redistribution of PPE's amonngst hospitals/regions/states during shortages like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beyond scientific research, I am have a keen interest in philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing and doing some amateur philosophy. It is available to read at [my substack](https://abhinavkhare.substack.com/). I would love to get some feedback and comments about the contents of my writings.
