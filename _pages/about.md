I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at University at Buffalo, SUNY and my doctoral research is focussed on developing methods for social sensing during disasters and crisis for better resposne and improved decision making. I am skilled in machine learning, statistical modeling and mathematical optimisation and leverage them in my research goals. Apart from my doctoral research, I also have some experience in leveraging these skills in genomic data analysis for cancer research. Going forward, I want to keep building tools that aim to solve problems in the society. Apart from my research I also have an interest in philosophy, in particular philosophy of science and philosophy of mind. As a hooby I read about these subjects and write my thoughts pertaining to them.
