# Research Philosophy
My research interest is in network optimization, queuing systems, and machine learning with applications in transportation, and health care.
My research style is to understand performance limits of the systems, and develop efficient, adaptive, low-complexity, and new algorithms that are grounded in real-world operational data, implement them, and test them in both simulation and in field trials to gain a fundamental understanding of which techniques work well and why.
