My research philosophy is driven by the two primary motivations : <br />
1. Building solution methods to real world problems which have a social impact. 
2. Building solution methods with practical applicability.

To this end, I have focussed my effort in research areas like healthcare, disaster preparation and planning and humanitarian logistics. I believe, to increase the applicability of decision models in the literature of Operations Research, they must be able incorporate real-time actionable information. Massive advances in information processing and machine learning have led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. Decision models can greatly benifit from these advances as information processed from these upstream AI models are potential sources of actionable information to be incrporated in mathematical decision models. In my doctoral research, I use this approach in improving real-time decisions for disaster management. I apply Natural Language Processing on social media to gather actionable information and develop decision models that utilise this information and make optimal decision for disaster planning. Following is a more detailed description of my research: 


## Shortage of Essential Commodities during Disasters and Role of Social Media

Shortage of essential commodities is commonly observed when a disaster or epidemic is announced. For instance, shortage of gasoline was observed prior to the landfall of Hurricane Irma in Florida (2017) and  after  the  landfall  of  Hurricane  Sandy  in  New  York/New  Jersey (2012).  When the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in the United States in March 2020, a large number of stores ran out of essential commodities such as hand sanitizers and face masks.  An accurate prediction and forecasts of the surges in demand and subsequent shortages could help the affected population, authorities, first responders plan better. Social media contains signals for such predictions and forecasts. A lot of people report shortages and their needs during disasters. For instance, during the shortage of PPE's during Covid-19 onset in US #GetmePPE was trending. In the case of gasoline shortage during Hurricane Irma, the signal was hidden in the noise. Tweets of the following kind were obsserved in major cities of Florida: <br />

"The shelters are full, there is no gas. Tornados could happen, and storm surge is predicted. So what are people supposed to do? #Irma"<br />
"Insane..95 percent of Florida trying to leave at one time. Roads r slammed. No gas. No hotels available. Scared to see my neighborhood after irma"<br />
"Gas stations out of gas, water shelves empty, stores and airports closed. Stocked up on food and wine, waiting on irma"

Such tweets were observed from Sept 6th, 2017 when evacuation zones were annouced to Sept 9th, 2017 on the day of the landfall of Hurricane Irma. The following figure describes the spatio temporal distribution of tweets. We wanted to explore if the these tweets can act as sensors for detecting the locations and times of this shortage. We also wanted to build a methodology to forecast future shortages given the current signal about shortage from social media.
