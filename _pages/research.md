My research philosophy is driven by the two primary motivations : <br />
1. Building solution methods to real world problems which have a social impact. 
2. Building solution methods with practical applicability.

To this end, I have focussed my effort in research areas like healthcare, disaster preparation and planning and humanitarian logistics.


I believe, to increase the applicability of decision models in OR, they must be able incorporate real-time actionable information. Massive advances in information processing and machine learning have led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. Decision models can greatly benifit from these advances as information processed from these upstream AI models are potential sources of actionable information to be incrporated in mathematical decision models. In my doctoral research, I use this approach in improving real-time decisions for disaster management. I apply Natural Language Processing on social media to gather actionable information and develop decision models that utilise this information and make optimal decision for disaster planning. Following is a more detailed description of my research: 


## Shortage of Essential Commodities during Disasters and Role of Social Media

Shortage of essential commodities is commonly observed when a disaster or epidemic is announced. For instance, shortage of gasoline was observed prior to the landfall of Hurricane Irma in Florida (2017)  and  after  the  landfall  of  Hurricane  Sandy  in  New  York/New  Jersey (2012).  When the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in the United States in March 2020, a large number of stores ran out of essential commodities such as hand sanitizers and face masks.  An accurate prediction and forecasts of the surges in demand and subsequent shortages could help the affected population, authorities, first responders plan better. Social media contains signals for such predictions and forecasts. A lot of people report shortages and their needs during disasters. For instance, during the shortage of PPE's during Covid-19 onset in US #GetmePPE was trending. In the case of demand of gasoline during Hurricane Irma, the signal was hidden in the noise. Tweets of the following kind were obsserved in major cities of Florida:
