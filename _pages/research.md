# Research Philosophy

My research philosophy is driven by the motivation to build solution methods to real world problems which have big social impact. To this end, I have focussed my effort in research areas like healthcare, disaster preparation and planning and humanitarian logistics. I am especially interested in building solution methods that have high applicability in real-life scenarios. I believe, to increase the applicability of decision models of OR, they must be able incorporate real-time actionable information. Massive adavances in information processing and machine learning in the past few years have led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. Decision models in Operations Research and Management Science can benifit greatly from these advances as information processed from these upstream AI models are sources of parameter estimation and actionable information and optimse for better real-time decisions. In my doctoral research, I use this approach in improving real-time decisions for disaster management.
