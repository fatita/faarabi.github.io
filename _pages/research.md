# Research Philosophy

My research philosophy is driven by the two primary motivations :
1. Building solution methods to real world problems which have a social impact 
2. Building solution methods with practical applicability.

I have foucssed my research in areas like disaster mangement and healthcare which have high social impact. I believe, to increase the applicability of decision models from literature of Operations Research in the real world, they must be able incorporate real-time actionable information. Advances in information processing and machine learning have led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. Decision models can greatly benifit from these advances as information processed from these AI models are potential sources of actionable information to be incrporated in mathematical models for real-time decision making. In my doctoral research, I used this approach in improving real-time decisions for disaster management. I applied Natural Language Processing on social media to gather actionable information and develop decision models that utilise this information and make optimal decision for disaster planning. Following is a short description of my research.

# Shortage of Essential Commodities during Disasters and Role of Social Media

Shortage of essential commodities is commonly observed when a disaster or epidemic is announced. For instance, shortage of gasoline was observed prior to the landfall of Hurricane Irma in Florida (2017) and  after  the  landfall  of  Hurricane  Sandy  in  New  York/New  Jersey (2012).  When the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in the United States in March 2020, a large number of stores ran out of essential commodities such as hand sanitizers and face masks.  An accurate prediction and forecasts of the surges in demand and subsequent shortages could help the affected population, authorities, first responders plan better. Social media contains signals for such predictions and forecasts. A lot of people report shortages and their needs during disasters. For instance, during the shortage of PPE's during Covid-19 onset in US #GetmePPE was trending. Tweets about gasoline shortage were observed in major cities of Florida during Hurricane: <br />

*"The shelters are full, there is **no gas**. Tornados could happen, and storm surge is predicted. So what are people supposed to do? #Irma"*<br />
*"Insane..95 percent of Florida trying to leave at one time. Roads r slammed. **No gas**. No hotels available. Scared!!!"*<br />
*"Gas stations **out of gas**, water shelves empty, stores and airports closed. Stocked up on food and wine, waiting on irma*"

The following figure describes the spatio temporal distribution of tweets. We wanted to explore if the these tweets can act as sensors for detecting the locations and times of this shortage. We also wanted to build a methodology to forecast future shortages given the current signal about shortage from social media.
