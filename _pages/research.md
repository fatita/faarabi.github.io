## Research Philosophy

My research philosophy is driven by the two primary motivations : 
1) Building solution methods to real world problems which have big social impact. 
2) Building solution methods with greater practical applicability.

To this end, I have focussed my effort in research areas like healthcare, disaster preparation and planning and humanitarian logistics. I believe, to increase the applicability of decision models in OR, they must be able incorporate real-time actionable information. Massive adavances in information processing and machine learning in the past few years have led to massive improvements in perception tasks of AI like computer vision and natural language processing. Decision models in Operations Research & Management Science can greatly benifit from these advances as information processed from these upstream AI models are potential sources of actionable information to be incrporated in mathematical decision models. In my doctoral research, I use this approach in improving real-time decisions for disaster management. I use Natural Language Processing on social media as a source for actionable information and develop decision models that utilise this information and make optimal decision for disaster planning. For instance, using this method, we could estimate the probability of shortage of gasoline at different gas stations in Forida during Hurricane Irma and used this for optimising search paths for evacuators who were looking to fill there gas tanks before evacuating. Following is a more detailed description of my research:
